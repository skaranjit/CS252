<b><font size=+1>CSIS 252 - Fall 2019</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Assignment #1</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+1>Due Tuesday, November 19 @ noon.</font></b>
<p>The purpose of this program is array processing and using functions.
   Write a C++ program on smaug to process student test scores
   outputting results for each student followed by summary information
   for the class as a whole.   
<p>Input is from the keyboard and consists of the following
   <ul>
   <li>Maximum score (int) - the maximum number of points possible.
   <li>Student test scores (int) read until the sentinel value -1 is input.
       All student test scores are to be stored in an array of int
   </ul>

<p>Following the input, output is to the screen and consists of the following
   <ul>
   <li>Each student test score (int), percentage (floating point) and 
       letter grade (char) in tabular form.  Each of the 3 columns should
       labeled and line up nicely with the percentage formatted to 2 
       decimal places.  The scores will be in descending order so the
       array must be sorted. The letter grade is calculated as 
       90%, 80%, 70%, 60% for A B C D. Below 60% is an F.  Click
       <a href="tabular.txt">HERE</a> for an example of what I mean by tabular
       form.
   <li>Summary information neatly formatted including (and in the order given):
       <ul>
       <li>maximum score
       <li>the number of students processed
       <li>high score
       <li>low score
       <li>average score
       <li>median score
       </ul>
   </ul>

<h3>Requirements and Comments</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use constants for the sentinel value, grade ranges, and the array size.
<li>Declare the size of the array to be 30.
<li>Your <i>main</i> function consists only of function calls (click
    <a href="main4.cpp">HERE</a> for my main function which you are welcome
    to use).
    <ol>
    <li>read the data
    <li>sort the test scores (click <a href="sort.cpp">HERE</a> for a sort
        function)
    <li>output student results
    <li>output summary 
    </ol>
<li>The functions that output (#3 and #4 above) should call other 
    functions.  Anything that requires more than one line of code should be 
    a function.
<li>You may assume all input is correct. In other words, if someone
    entering input enters a float or a negative value or whatever for a
    test score,
    that's their problem and odd results are the fault of data
    entry, not the program.  When I grade your program, I'll enter
    only valid data.
<li>All floating point output should be formatted to 2 decimal places.
    Be wise in determining what is int and what is floating point.
<li>Do not include extra fancy stuff in what you turn in.  You are
    welcome to experiment with such stuff if you want, but it should
    be removed for what you turn in.  What I mean is don't clear the
    screen for each score, don't make me press return to continue,
    etc. While such things may be nice, it just makes my grading task 
    more difficult.
<li>Clean up your directory (to prepare for handing it in), so that the
    only file in your directory is <i><b>main.cpp</b></i>.
<li>tar and compress your lastname4 directory creating 
    lastname4.tar.gz and hand it in
    to the assignment4 dropbox on D2L.
<li>Be sure to use proper documentation, indentation, input prompts, and
    labeling output.
<li><b>RE-READ</b> this assignment sheet before you turn your program in to
    make sure you are doing everything as described.

</ul>
