Instructions
Write the definitions of the functions of the class primeFactorization (Example 11-4) declared in the primeFactorization header file. Write a program that uses this class to output the prime factorization of an integer. Your program should prompt the user for an integer, determine if the input is a prime number, and display the factorization of the integer.

An example of the program is shown below:

Enter an integer between 2 and 270,000,000,000,000: 1005427

1005427 is a prime number. Its factorization is:
1005427 = 1005427
